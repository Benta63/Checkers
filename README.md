# Checkers in Prolog

Here is my implementation of checkers in Prolog where I used alpha beta pruning. This was developed in SWI Prolog 8.03. In order to run the program, type *play.* From here a list of possible moves will be displayed as well as the current state of the board. Type the number corresponding to the moves you want to make followed by a period. For example, *1.*  This will play the corresponding move. The computer will then play a move and the new state of the board will be reported to you. From here, you will be displayed the possible moves and the cycle will continue until someone wins.
